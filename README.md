# Hi everybody

I'm @bloerglech, a chemical engineer who likes music, skate and data.

Sometimes I go with my film camera taking photos of my city

I'm currently working in a Pulp Mill, as Production Manager.

Not to confident on my knowledge, but always trying to improve.

    finishing my master's degree in Data Science
